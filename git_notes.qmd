## Basics of using git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is very popular. 

The core steps to using Git involve

1. Initiate a Git repository
    In RStudio, we just click a little radio button on project creation
    At the command line, we type:
    `git init`

2. Do your normal work
    Add files
    Modify files etc.
    
3. Add your important files to the "staged" 
    In RStudio, we click the "staged" radio button
    `git add yourfilename`
    
4. Commit your staged files to the repository
    In RStudio you just hit the "Commit" button and add a msg
    `git commit -m "your wee msg"`
    
5. Git Push to sync changes TO GitHub
    The Up arrow in RStudio
    `git push`
    
6. Git Pull to sync FROM Github
    The Down arrow in RStudio
    `git pull`

You can check your project "history" and status 
    `git status`
    `git log` (push Q to exit)
